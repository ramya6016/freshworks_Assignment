FILE BASED CRD OF A DATASTORE:

*This is a simple file based crd datastore.
*In this datastore, you can create , read and delete.
*The key and values are stored in the "values.txt" which is stored in the local storage of the laptop.
*if the key value pair is deleted, then the pair is deleted from the "values.txt"
*The functions are create(),read(),destroy().

Argument explanation:
* create(key,value,time_to_live,new_file)
    key=key value to be entered
    value=value to be entered
    time_to_live=the secs left to expiry
    new_file= new_file=0->if you want to use the old datastore.
              new_file=1->if you want to create new datastore.
* read(key)
    key=Whose value has to be read.
* destroy(key)
    key=whose value has to be deleted
